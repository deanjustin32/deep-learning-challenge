## Introduction
This analysis is to evaluate a neural network model developed to predict the success of funding ventures by The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup . The model is trained on a CSV dataset containing containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

## Model Architecture
The neural network model used in this analysis consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The number of input features and the number of hidden nodes in each layer are determined based on the structure of the dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using a training dataset, and its performance is evaluated using a separate testing dataset. 

## Results

*What is the loss value of the model?

    *The loss value of the model is 0.5577.

*What is the accuracy of the model?

    *The accuracy of the model is 72.77%.
    
*How long did it take to train the model?

    *The model took approximately 485 milliseconds per epoch to train.
    
*What was the batch size used during training?

    *The batch size used during training was 32.
    
*What was the number of epochs used during training?

    *The model was trained for 100 epochs.
    
*How does the model's accuracy compare to the desired target accuracy of 75%?

    *The model's accuracy of 72.77% is below the desired target accuracy of 75%.
    
## Summary
The neural network model achieved an accuracy of 72.77% in predicting the success of charitable organizations. Although the model's accuracy falls slightly below the desired target of 75%, it still demonstrates a reasonable level of performance. However, there is room for improvement to achieve higher accuracy.
